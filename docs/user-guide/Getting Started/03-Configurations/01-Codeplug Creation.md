# Codeplug Creation

A codeplug is a YAML configuration file that defines the systems, tabs, resources, and group tabs used by the console.

At minimum, a codeplug defines:

- `systems`
- `zones`

Common optional sections include:

- `groups`
- `keyFile`
- `patchSourceIdPassthrough`
- `web_streams` under a zone

---

# Compatibility

The Avalonia application preserves the current YAML contract and accepts the legacy `patchGroups` key. Review older codeplugs before use because unsupported or misspelled values can still produce a valid YAML file with incorrect operator behavior.

---

# Basic Structure

```yaml
keyFile: "Full/Path/To/Keyfile.clear"

systems:
  - ...

groups:
  - ...

patchSourceIdPassthrough: false

zones:
  - ...
```

---

# Systems

Systems define FNE connections.

Example:

```yaml
systems:
  - name: "System 1"
    identity: "Console 1"
    address: "fne.example.local"
    port: 62031
    peerId: 1000001
    rid: "1001"
    password: "RPT_PASSWORD"
    encrypted: false
    presharedKey: "123ABC1234"
    aliasPath: "Full/Path/To/alias.yml"
```

Fields:

- `name`: internal system name. Channels reference this value.
- `identity`: peer identity shown to the FNE.
- `address`: FNE hostname or IP address.
- `port`: FNE port.
- `peerId`: peer ID used for the console connection.
- `rid`: radio ID used when the console transmits and when it requests configured P25 keys through FNE/KMM.
- `password`: FNE password.
- `encrypted`: whether the FNE connection uses transport encryption.
- `presharedKey`: key used when `encrypted` is enabled.
- `kmfPresharedKey`: optional separate key used only to decrypt peer-encrypted P25 KMM responses; it is never inferred from `presharedKey`.
- `aliasPath`: optional RID alias YAML file.

---

# Zones

Zones become main console tabs.

Example:

```yaml
zones:
  - name: "Primary"
    tabColor: "#E57373"
    tabTextColor: "#000000"
    channels:
      - ...
```

Fields:

- `name`: tab label.
- `tabColor`: tab background color in hex.
- `tabTextColor`: tab text color in hex.
- `channels`: resources shown on that tab.
- `web_streams`: optional web URL stream chips shown on that tab.

Long tab names are allowed. The console trims long labels so activity icons remain visible.

---

# Channels

Channels define resource cards.

Example:

```yaml
channels:
  - name: "Channel 1"
    system: "System 1"
    tgid: "2001"
    mode: "p25"
    keyId: 0x50
    algo: "aes"
    selectable_encryption: true
    resourceColor: "#150282"
    rx_only: false
    card_size: normal
```

Fields:

- `name`: resource/card name.
- `system`: system name from the `systems` section.
- `tgid`: target talkgroup ID.
- `mode`: `p25`, `dmr`, `nxdn`, or `analog`. If omitted, P25 is used. NXDN is the 4800-baud voice mode; NXDN 9600/EFR is not implemented in dvmhost.
- `keyId`: optional encryption key ID.
- `algo`: optional encryption algorithm, such as `aes`, `des`, `arc4`, or `none`.
- `selectable_encryption`: optional flag for P25, DMR, or NXDN secure-capable resources. When `true`, the card shows a **SELECT** toggle so operators can choose encrypted or clear transmit. This requires a valid `keyId` and `algo`.
- `resourceColor`: optional resource card color in hex.
- `rx_only`: optional receive-only flag. When `true`, the resource card hides PTT, alert tone select, and channel marker/hold controls, and the resource is skipped by global, patch/group, and alert-tone transmit target paths.
- `card_size`: optional fixed resource card size. Supported values are `small`, `normal`, and `large`. If omitted or invalid, `normal` is used.
- `slot`: optional DMR slot field if used by the deployment.

The console validates target TGs against active talkgroup rules received from the connected FNE when a user attempts to transmit or otherwise use the TG.

Card size behavior:

- `small`: compact status/PTT card. The volume slider, alert tone select, channel marker, and call history buttons are hidden.
- `normal`: default resource card size and layout.
- `large`: larger resource card with larger text and controls.

---

# Web Streams

Web streams define compact URL audio chips on a zone tab.

Example:

```yaml
web_streams:
  - name: "Stream 1"
    url: "https://streams.example.local/stream-1"
    authUsername: "stream-user"
    authPassword: "stream-password"
    idleColor: "#150282"
```

Fields:

- `name`: stream chip label. Keep names unique because saved position, volume, active startup state, and output routing are keyed by name.
- `url`: direct HTTP or HTTPS audio stream URL. WAV and MP3 are supported by the built-in decoder. Other formats require a compatible FFmpeg executable selected with `DVM_FFMPEG`.
- `authUsername`: optional HTTP Basic Auth username for protected streams.
- `authPassword`: optional HTTP Basic Auth password for protected streams.
- `idleColor`: optional active-idle chip color in hex. If omitted, the standard selected-resource blue is used.

Web stream chips start disabled after console load. Click the chip to start or stop local playback.

If **Restore Selected Channels On Startup** is enabled, active web streams are saved on shutdown and restarted on the next console launch.

Basic Auth credentials are stored in the codeplug file. Protect the file if protected stream credentials are configured.

When clicked on, the chip turns amber while connecting. The console tries up to three connection attempts with a short delay between attempts before marking the stream down.

When active, the chip turns green when audio is detected. If the stream URL is unreachable or cannot be decoded, the chip turns red and shows `Down`. Click a down stream once to return it to the off state.

Web streams are local monitor widgets only. They are not patch or multi-select members.

---

# Groups

Groups define tabs in the Groups window.

Example:

```yaml
groups:
  - name: "Patch 1"
    type: "patch"
  - name: "Multi Select 1"
    type: "multiselect"
```

Fields:

- `name`: group tab label.
- `type`: `patch` or `multiselect`.

Group memberships are assigned in the Groups window, not in the codeplug.

Patch group members persist across restart. Patch active state is separate and only persists when **Settings > Retain Patch State on Startup** is enabled.

Legacy `patchGroups` entries are treated as patch groups for compatibility.

---

# Patch Source ID Passthrough

`patchSourceIdPassthrough` controls source IDs on forwarded patch traffic.

```yaml
patchSourceIdPassthrough: false
```

When `false`, forwarded patch traffic uses the configured console RID for the destination system.

When `true`, the console attempts to pass through the inbound source ID while forwarding patch audio.

---

# Key File

Use `keyFile` to reference a YAML key file:

```yaml
keyFile: "Full/Path/To/Keyfile.clear"
```

The file is the automatic fallback for configured P25 keys. After each system connects, the console first requests those keys through FNE/KMM; a valid system-scoped KMM key takes precedence until that FNE disconnects. See **Encryption Keys** for the file format and runtime behavior.

---

      - name: "Channel 3"

        mode: "dmr"
```

# Recommended Practices

- Keep system names stable after deployment because channels reference them.
- Use clear channel names because saved positions and volume are keyed by channel name.
- Use clear group names, such as `Patch 1` or `Multi Select 1`.
- Keep zone tabs short enough for operators to scan quickly.
- Verify each channel references a valid system.
- Verify each group has a supported `type`.
- Keep web stream names stable so saved chip position and volume remain associated with the correct stream.
- Confirm TGs exist in FNE talkgroup rules before relying on them operationally.
