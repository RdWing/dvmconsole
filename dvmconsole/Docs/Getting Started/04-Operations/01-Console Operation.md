# Console Operation

This page covers common operator workflows on the main console.

# Selecting Resources

Click a resource card to select or deselect it.

Selected resources are monitored locally. If a receiving resource is deselected while active, local monitoring for that resource stops and the card RX state is cleared.

Use **Select All/Unselect All** from the toolbar to quickly toggle selected resources.

Each transmit-capable card has three independent routing selectors:

- `TX` includes the resource in global or multi-channel voice PTT.
- `PAGE` includes the resource when a QCII page is sent.
- `ALERT` includes the resource when DTMF, a generated tone, a tone preset, or an alert audio file is sent.

Purple indicates an armed selector. Gray indicates that selector is not armed.
The selectors do not use check marks, and moving the pointer over an armed
selector does not change its state. Click the selector to arm or disarm only
that routing path.

The `TAR` button occupies the same control row. It enables or disables local
Talkgroup Audio Recorder capture for that resource. Receive monitoring itself
is controlled by clicking the card, so there is no separate listen button.

The talkgroup and protocol are shown together as `TG 9990 - DMR` or
`TG 9990 - P25`.

# Resource Card Sizes

Resource card size is defined in the codeplug with `card_size`.

Supported sizes:

- `small`: compact status/PTT card. Volume, alert tone select, channel marker, and call history buttons are hidden.
- `normal`: default card size.
- `large`: larger card with larger text and controls.

If `card_size` is omitted, the console uses `normal`.

---

# PTT

Use a resource card PTT button to transmit on that resource.

The console supports normal press-and-hold PTT and toggle PTT mode.

Toggle PTT mode is controlled by:

```
Settings > Toggle Push To Talk Mode
```

Toggle PTT is off by default. If changed, the preference is saved.

---

# Selectable Encryption

Some P25 secure-capable resources may show **SELECT** in the card text area.

Click **SELECT** to toggle that resource between encrypted and clear console transmit. The choice is saved by system/talkgroup and restored on the next startup.

If the resource does not show **SELECT**, encryption behavior is fixed by the codeplug.

---

# Global PTT

Global PTT keys the current primary selected channel.

If no primary channel is available, legacy all-channel global PTT behavior is not exposed in the menu. Use multi-select groups instead when an operator needs to transmit to multiple resources.

The global PTT key remains active while the modeless **Console Tools** window
has focus. Console Tools can stay open while the operator selects resources or
uses other controls in the main window.

---

# Transmit Tail

When PTT is released, the console briefly holds transmit before sending call-end signaling.

This short de-key tail helps prevent clipped final syllables and final voice frames.

The tail affects the real transmit path, not only the UI.

---

# Talkgroup Validation

When a user tries to transmit or use a talkgroup, the console checks the active talkgroup rules received from the connected FNE.

If the talkgroup is unavailable on that FNE, the action is blocked and this warning is shown:

```
Target TG unavailable on FNE
```

This validation is per system and applies to P25 and DMR resources.

---

# RX Activity

When selected resources receive traffic, the card shows RX activity and source information.

Tabs show an audio activity icon when a resource on that tab is receiving. Long tab names are trimmed so the activity icon remains visible.

---

# Web Stream Chips

Codeplug-defined web stream chips appear on the zone tab where they are configured.

Click a stream chip to start or stop playback. Streams load in the off state unless **Restore Selected Channels On Startup** is enabled and the stream was active at shutdown.

Stream chips use a compact volume slider. User volume changes are saved by stream name, and the chip turns green when audio is detected.

When a stream is starting, the chip turns amber while connecting. The console tries up to three connection attempts before marking the stream down.

If a stream URL is unreachable or cannot be decoded, the chip turns red and shows `Down`. Click a down stream once to return it to the off state.

Protected streams can use HTTP Basic Auth through `authUsername` and `authPassword` fields in the codeplug.

Web streams are local monitor widgets. They are not patch or multi-select members.

The reset tab layout action also moves web stream chips on the active tab and saves their new positions.

---

# Sticky Selected Channels

Controlled by:

```
Settings > Restore Selected Channels On Startup
```

When enabled:

- selected resources are restored on startup
- saved volume for restored resources is restored
- encrypted restored resources request keys after FNE connection and a short delay

When disabled:

- resources start unselected
- per-resource volumes start at default

---

# Card Indicator Icons

The top-right card indicator can show membership state.

Common meanings:

- active patch member
- disabled patch member
- multi-select member

Multi-select membership takes visual priority when both patch and multi-select memberships apply.
